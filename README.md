### Hi there 👋


My name is Diego Dominguez and I am currently a student at Boise State University and Boise CodeWorks. I have a strong background in leadership from being a Boise State Orientation Leader and current Chairman of Diversity & Inclusion of Pi Kappa Alpha  Fraternity at Boise State University. I am always trying to learn new things and have recently grasped a huge passion for coding! I love expressing myself through style and Software Development has just given me another way of expressing myself through the design of my projects. Although I haven't been in the software developing world too long I completely love the front end aspect of my projects. 

Pronouns: He/Him/His

Current Learning Languages/Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Vue.js, Bootstrap, MVC pattern

About Me:

🌮 - I love the process of making homemade meals and adding my own personal touch to them

🏀⚽️ - I will always talk about soccer or basketball any chance I get
